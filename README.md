It is better if we add this below fetures for further more update

Max Score Feature: Create a variable called 'max score'. After each quiz, compare the current score with the max score. If the current score is higher, update the max score.

Enhance JSON: Use tools like GenAI or GPT-3 to generate a more comprehensive JSON for your quiz. You can also manually create a more detailed JSON.

Randomize Questions: Implement a function to randomize the order of questions. This can be achieved by writing a sorting algorithm that sorts based on question length, type, or answer length. This ensures a unique experience each time the user opens the quiz.

Large Question Bank: Instead of randomizing, you can create a large question bank (20-30 questions) and randomly select a subset (e.g., 10 questions) for each quiz.

JavaScript Logic: The optimizations suggested here are not about DOM manipulation, but about basic JavaScript logic.
